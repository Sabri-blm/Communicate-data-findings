## Summary of Findings

> While exploring the data i found that most individuals who are given loans are employed with a loan duration of 36 month on average, as well we found that the these borrowers on average have 5000 monthly income which augmented their chances on getting these loan's.
The primary loan category was debt followed by home improvement which was surprising 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> i have chosen a couple of plot that can depict the results that i found in my exploratory analysis (what kind of status does the borrowers needs to augment the chances of getting a loan/number of investor).

> At first, we started by introducing the employement status for the borrowers (which we found that the majority are employed). After that, we went to see the loan status, and lastly we presented the monthly income stated by the borrowers. i have plotted these findings using countplots and histograms and i simplified them as much as i can.
